In This Reposetory I created Project that Angular 16-based user registration and profile management system with photo upload, age selection, and interest input. Validates first name and address input, offers profile editing, and photo change functionality. Utilizes Semantic Markup, Reactive forms, rxjs libraries, and JSON server for API.
